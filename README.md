# ML-image-classification
This project uses a custom-trained YOLOv8 model to detect Indian cricket players, specifically Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, in real-world images. Built on Google Colab using the Ultralytics YOLO library, the goal was to explore image classification techniques by working with images of favorite cricketers.
